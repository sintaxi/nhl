# NHL API

This application is a demonstration of using NodeJS to
create an API by screen scraping nhl.com. It caches the
json payloads with redis (set to 2 min).

## Install Dependencies

    npm install

You’ll also need to install redis, either from [the website](http://redis.io/) or by using the command line:

    curl -O http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-2.8.19.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf redis-2.8.21.tar.gz
    cd redis-2.8.21.tar.gz
    make
    sudo make install

After it’s installed, start redis using the command:

    redis-server

If you restart your machine, you’ll need to run this command again. Otherwise, redis is now running in the background.

## Run

The following command will start the server:

    node server.js

The server defaults to port `80`, which may require `sudo` or admin privledges. Alternatively, you can specify a different port while you’re developing locally:

    PORT=8001 node server.js
    # Available at http://localhost:8001

## API

In your browser or by using `curl` in the command line, you can now grab the team stats…

    http://localhost:8001/oilers

Or, specify a season…

    http://localhost:8001/oilers/20052006
